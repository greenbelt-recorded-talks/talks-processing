### Burning CDs

The Team Leaders and the shop team will decide on which talks (if any) to burn to CD, and when. Usually, there will be some expected "best sellers" that the shop team will want several copies of as soon as possible, but other talks will be burned on request, when festival-goers order them at the shop. 

To burn CDs for talks:

* Check that the talk is actually ready to be burned. Go to the [talks page](talks) and check that the Processed file is available for the talk that you want to burn. If it is, then you're good to go
* Make sure that you know which CD drive has which number (if they have stickers on, it's a good bet they're right)
* Log in to the server via SSH (instructions for this will be provided separately - talk to the team leaders)
* Put the CD in the drive
* run: `cd /home/gbtalks/talks-processing/cd_tools`
* To write (for example) talk gb22-99 to drive 1, run: `./makecd.sh 99 1` 

If it works, after a few minutes, the drive will eject and you'll see a message saying `TALK GB22-99 WRITTEN TO DRIVE 1". 

If it hasn't worked, you'll see a load of error messages go past. Talk to Rob if this happens!

### Making Talks USBs

There's no magic to these. 

Once all of the talks that have been ordered have been processed (check on the [talks page](talks)), just grab an 8GB USB stick and use the nearest available laptop to download the files from the server and copy them to the USB stick. Make sure that the USB bag has this year's sticker on it, and send it back to the shop when it's done.

### Making All Talks USBs (for this year)

We have two types of USB sticks for duplicating on to: USB2 sticks, which are cheaper but much slower, and USB3 sticks, which are faster but cost more. There's only a few Â£ in it, but over hundreds of sticks, it really adds up!

Therefore, we use USB2 sticks as much as possible, and USB3 sticks when we need to work quickly. 

It's important not to mix-and-match USB types: if a USB2 stick is plugged into a hub, the entire hub runs at USB2 speeds until it's removed. 

Broadly, the way that we make the All Talks USB is by creating a "gold" copy which has all of the talks that we want to put on the USB (and none of the ones that we don't!), plus the PDF of the talks list. This lives in `/usb_gold` on the server.  


On-site, on Monday night, it's important that you use only USB3 sticks, because they're much faster. Any USB2 stick plugged into the server will slow down the whole operation, so USB3 sticks only. You can identify USB3 sticks by the blue plastic in the USB port, and they'll be either 16GB or 128GB. 

* Log into the server
* `cd /home/gbtalks/talks-processing/gbtalks`
* `source .ve/bin/activate`
*

### Making All Talks USBs (for previous years)

There is a complete archive of GB Talks on the server in the `/backups/talks` directory. Copy those (with `scp` or `rsync`) to your local computer, and copy them to a USB stick. 

It's unlikely that there will be any of these orders in 2022, as all previous talks are available free on the website.

### Making All Talks DVDs (for any year)

Only a fool would do this. Put the order form on Rob's to-do pile, and pray for his immortal soul. We'll do all DVD orders after the festival.
