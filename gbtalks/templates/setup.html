### Setup

This page provides a range of tools that set up the application. Use with care: this allows you to break things in interesting ways.

### Upload All Talks Index File

The All Talks USB stick has a PDF file on it which lists out what all of the talks are. We create this during the festival (usually based on the order form), and update it as talks are either added or removed from the list. 

Uploading a file here will replace the existing one. 

{% endfilter %}

        <form action="put_alltalks_pdf" method=post enctype=multipart/form-data>
                <label for=file>File</label>
                <input name=file type=file id=file accept=".pdf">
                <button>Submit</button>
        </form>

### Upload Icon

The icon is used as the cover image for MP3 files. It must be a square PNG, recommended 300x300 pixels. 

Uploading a file here will replace the existing one.

### Replace Talks File

The Talks File is the list of talks. It must be a CSV file (with utf-8 encoding, otherwise accented characters won't work).

You'll probably get a list of talks in some sort of spreadsheet format from GBHQ. You'll normally need to do some prep work to get it ready to import: remove any talks that we don't want to record, check that the columns are ordered correctly (see below), make sure that there is only one header line. 

The first line of the file is discarded, as it is assumed to be column headings. 

The columns are pre-set in the code: edit the file if these don't match the columns you've got. Column numbers below start from 0:

	Column 0: Talk ID, e.g. "gb99-001"
	Column 1: Venue, e.g. "A Field"
	Column 2: Day, e.g. "Friday"
	Column 3: Time, e.g. "20:15"
	Column 4: Title, e.g. "My Great Talk"
	Column 6: Speaker, e.g. "Dr Awesome"
	Column 7: Description, e.g. "Blah Blah Blah"
	Column 8: Is this talk a "must-record" / "priority" talk? Must be "Yes" or blank
	Column 9: Should a recorder be rota-ed for this talk? Must be "Yes" or blank

All of those columns must be supplied, including the Priority and Rotaed columns, even if those mechanisms arent being used in a given year.  

Replacing the Talks File deletes all previous data: assignments, rotas, etc. Files on disk aren't deleted, so if any talk IDs change, the files will be the wrong ones. If you replace the talks file when the festival has started, the rota will be meaningless, so make sure that you've got a copy saved! Any changes that affect the rota will need to be accounted for manually.

It's probably best to talk to Rob before replacing the talks file during the festival.
